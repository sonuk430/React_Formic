# React Form Validation with Formik, Yup, and Tailwind CSS

This project demonstrates how to implement form validation in a React application using `Formik` for form management, `Yup` for validation schema, and `Tailwind CSS` for responsive styling. The form enables user registration with fields such as name, email, password, and confirm password, displaying a success message and user details upon successful submission.
